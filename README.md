Method 3 - Spotify: - First run the get_image_features_vectors.py and store the feature vector(.npz) files. After storing the features run the cluster_image_feature_vector.py which will create the similarity indexes and store in nearest_neighbors.json file. Populate the elasticsearch cluster using bulkAPI and run the flask app in 'elasticsearch folder' to display the nearest neighbor in web app.
